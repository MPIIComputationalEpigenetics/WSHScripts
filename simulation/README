This file should guide you how to use the scripts located in the directory to simulate a specific scenario and then to test the ISH scores FDRP, qFDRP, PDR, Epipolymorphism, Entropy and MHL on the simulated data. First, you should select one of the scenarios you want to simulated. Those are located in 'annotation_generator' and briefly described here. 

create_cell_types.R: Simulates two cell types that share the methylation level over most of the 50kb region (randomly methylated or unmethylated), but one cell type has a random methylation level in a subregion of random length within the region. This could potentially lead a differentially methylated region between the two simulated cell types.

create_CGI_region.R: Simulates ISH scores around annotated (according to UCSC) CpG islands to model possible dependencies on higher CpG densities. In contrast to nature, CpG islands are not unmethylated, but methylation level is randomly selected (methylated or unmethylated), to exclude a possible influence of methylation on the ISH scores.

create_coverage.R: Simluates dependecies of the ISH scores on different coverage data sets.

create_read_length.R: Investigates possible dependencies of the ISH scores on different read length ranging from 40-150bp.

create_sequencing_errors.R: Randomly introduces artificial sequencing errors into the reads to model dependency of the ISH score on this phenomenon. Here, the sequencing error level is stepwise increased from 1 to 10 percent.

create_snps.R: Similar to sequencing errors, a defined number of SNPs is introduced into the read to model dependency of the scores on this characteristic.

create_switch.R: Simluates a region that changes its methylation state from one extreme to the other (unmethlyated -> methylated or vice versa) thus introducing a region of random length showing intermediate methylation values. The ISH scores should be higher in such a region.

After selecting one of the scenarios, you need to create the sample annotation sheet, which is one the inputs to the scripts and also is responsible for possible distributing of the individual jobs across a scientific compute cluster.
NOTE: The RnBeads package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RnBeads.html), as well as the annotation package RnBeads.hg38 (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/RnBeads.hg38.html), need to be installed in the R installation you are using.
